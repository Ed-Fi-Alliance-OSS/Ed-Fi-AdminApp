# Admin App 4.0 Functional Test

Below are the test cases for Admin App and using Gherkin to define the test cases. This first definition will use [Markdown With Gherkin](https://github.com/cucumber/gherkin/blob/main/MARKDOWN_WITH_GHERKIN.md) to define the test cases in a readable manner and future iterations may convert this into other formats to be used with automation in our C#, Playwright and other tools in the future.

> [!TIP]
> Some scenarios may change depending on future changes planned for the application.
